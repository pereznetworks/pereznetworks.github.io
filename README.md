# Welcome to my Web App Forge.

  - Please be careful, this is a ***LIVE*** Web App Forge.

    - There is stuff that works great...
      - and stuff that might not work great
      - creating verbose logging
      - and heightened states of anxiety.

  - There is lots of cool stuff:
    - Front-End HTML/CSS and Javascript
    - React Native, ReactJS, Bootstrap, Pug
    - DB Stuff: like Sequelize, MondoDb, PostgreSQL
    - Express Server-side CLI, Express API, Gulp, SASS and more

## Stuff that's in the works...

  - Moving Project Pages, html versions, for all Repos to this Project page

  - Updating Project Site (this site) and the underlying Bootstrap code 

  - Porting code for my web apps and demo sites to use a build environment
