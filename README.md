# Welcome to my Web App Forge.

  - Please be careful, this is a ***LIVE*** Web App Forge.

    - There is stuff that works great...
      - and stuff that might not work great
      - creating verbose logging
      - and heightened states of anxiety.

  - [.NET Maui (Multi-platform Application UI ) projects](.NETMaui.md)
