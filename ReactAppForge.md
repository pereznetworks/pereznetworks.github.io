# React App Forge  
By Daniel Perez

Welcome to my Web App Forge.

- Please be careful, this is a ***LIVE*** Web App Forge.
- There is lots of cool stuff:
  - Front-End HTML/CSS and Javascript
  - React, Pug, Gulp
  - DB Stuff: like Sequelize, MondoDb, PostgreSQL
  - Express Server-side CLI and Express API.

- Here are [Alpha Projects](#alpha-projects) and [Beta Projects](#beta-projects).
  - Some of these will have a separate repo on my GitHub site
  - These projects may crash, produce much verbose dumps, error logs and heightened states of anxiety.

- Most of the React Apps have been created by first bootstrapping with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
  - Then, with modification, eventually a cool functional React App emerges.

- Server-side apps begin with my own nodejs-expressjs-templater.
  - an Alpha version of this project in on the [wish list](#projects_in the works)

- [Release Projects](#release-projects)
  - Projects with finished features and complete UI :
    - [will be posted on a separate repo on my GitHub site](https://github.com/pereznetworks)
    - [and hosted live on my Heroku site, DAP-DEV](https://dap-dev.herokuapp.com).
